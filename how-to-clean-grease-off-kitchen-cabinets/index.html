<p>I havent cleaned all 15 knobs yet but when I get the grease off the kitchen cabinets I thought it would be a good time to clean the pulls at. The best cabinet cleaner for greasy cabinets is to use a solution made of equal parts water and white vinegar. The vinegar should be able to clear up the grease without streaking it.

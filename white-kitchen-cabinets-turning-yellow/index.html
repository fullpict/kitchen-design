<p>Oil-based paints also known as alkyd paints sometimes take on a yellowish cast because of the way they cure especially if your kitchen doesnt get much sun. White cabinets can end up with a yellowish tinge unlike darker cabinetry which seems to hide yellowing. However with a little and regular maintenance you can keep the whiteness intact.
